type Testerval  = Int 

---- Final Call --------


--------------------------------

-- data tester_val = Int


-- Issues in Your Code
-- The problem here is that Int is already a built-in type in Haskell.
-- This definition makes Int a constructor, which conflicts with Haskellâ€™s built-in Int type.
-- Also, the tester_val type does not allow storing actual integer values



-- Correcting the Code
-- If you want a custom data type that can store an integer value, you should do:

data TesterVal = TesterInt Int  -- Constructor that wraps an Int
    deriving Show


-- Best approach :

newtype TesterValue = TesterIntval Int
    deriving Show

-- This is a valid approach, and in this case, it's actually preferable to data because:

-- newtype introduces zero runtime overhead (GHC treats TesterVal just like Int under the hood).
-- You only have one constructor (TesterInt), making newtype a great fit.
